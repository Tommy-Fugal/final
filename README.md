# Online Shopping Dataset Analysis

This project aims to analyze an online shopping dataset using machine learning techniques to gain insights into customer behavior and predict coupon usage. The dataset contains various features such as customer demographics, transaction details, product information, and spending patterns. The goal is to predict whether a customer used a coupon in their transaction based on these features, which can help optimize marketing strategies and promotions.

We begin by exploring the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA), examining the distribution of key variables and identifying potential relationships between features. Preprocessing steps include handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are implemented to predict coupon usage. The project evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with the Random Forest model yielding the best results. Challenges faced during the project include handling missing values, feature selection, and model overfitting, which were addressed through appropriate techniques.

This analysis demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and model experimentation in solving real-world business problems, especially in the context of customer behavior prediction.
